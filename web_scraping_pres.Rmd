## Web Scraping

Grabbing data off web pages and making it suitable for analysis. 

It's almost as bad as scraping paint.

Before web scraping,

- see if the web site has an API
- see if someone has already written a script
- check with a data librarian
- Google "web scraping tools"


## Strategy

There is no one strategy. Every web page is different.

But the basic steps are as follows:

1. view the source code; see if there is something consistent about the tags surrounding the data you want
2. Read web page source code into R using `readLines` or functions from the `XML` package (or something else?)
3. clean the data in R 

Steps 1 and 2 are usually easy. Step 3 takes time.

## Example

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
