## Web Scraping

Grabbing data off web pages and making it suitable for analysis. 

Before web scraping,

- see if the web site has an API
- see if someone has already written a script
- check with a data librarian
- Google "web scraping tools"

Don't do it if you don't have to.

## Strategy

There is no single strategy. Every web page is different.

But a basic procedure in R (_for a single web page_) is as follows:

1. view the source code; see if there is something consistent about the tags surrounding the data you want
2. Read web page source code into R using `readLines` or functions from the `XML` package (or something else?)
3. clean the data in R 

Steps 1 and 2 are usually easy. Step 3 takes time.

What about multiple web pages? Loop through steps 2 and 3..

## Good skills to have

It helps to know...

- a little about HTML and XML
- a little something about regular expressions
- how to write a function and do some basic conditional looping


## Example
